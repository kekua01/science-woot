Some physics and chemistry code using Vpython and python.

CHEMISTRY:

Two python scripts I wrote for chem class to help with nomenclature. One will help you go from a chemical formula to its name, another the opposite.

PHYSICS:

Some cool simulations of several physics units' "practicums." These are written in VPython/Glowscript. I would recommend going to trinket.io and running them in the Vpython shell.
Here are the links for each simulation:

Projectile Motion: hitting a falling waterballoon with a cannon shot.

Spring on Ramp: Adjust the coefficients of friction, and/or the spring constant to see how long the block will slide along the ramp.

Slingshot: Save your falling friend from falling into the abyss. Click on the screen to fire.

Sliding Blocks: Adjust the settings, but the blocks will always end up as close to the end of the ramp as possible.

Batman: Click once to fire the grappling hook and swing batman. Click again to release – try to gain some forward motion without breaking the tensile strength of the rope.
